active_record_slave [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/reidmorrison/active_record_slave.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/reidmorrison/active_record_slave)
===================

ActiveRecord drop-in solution to efficiently redirect reads to slave databases

* http://github.com/reidmorrison/active_record_slave

## Introduction

active_record_slave allows all database reads to go to a slave while ensuring
that all writes go to the master database. Also, active_record_slave ensures that
any reads that are performed in a transaction will always go to the master
database to ensure data consistency.

## Features

* Redirecting reads to a single slave database
* Works with any database driver that works with ActiveRecord
* Supports all Rails 3 read apis, including dynamic finders, AREL, and ActiveRecord::Base.select
* Transaction aware. Detects when a query is inside of a transaction and sends
  those reads to the master
* Lightweight footprint
* No overhead whatsoever when a slave is not configured
* Negligible overhead when redirecting reads to the slave
* Connection Pools to both databases are retained and maintained independently by ActiveRecord
* The master and slave databases do not have to be of the same type.
  For example one can be MySQL and the other Oracle if required.
* Debug logs include a prefix of 'Slave: ' to indicate which SQL statements are going
  to the slave database

### Example showing Slave redirected read

```ruby
# Read from the slave database
r = Role.where(:name => "manager").first
r.description = 'Manager'

# Save changes back to the master database
r.save!
```

Log file output:

    03-13-12 05:56:05 pm,[2608],b[0],[0],  Slave: Role Load (3.0ms)  SELECT `roles`.* FROM `roles` WHERE `roles`.`name` = 'manager' LIMIT 1
    03-13-12 05:56:22 pm,[2608],b[0],[0],  AREL (12.0ms)  UPDATE `roles` SET `description` = 'Manager' WHERE `roles`.`id` = 5

### Example showing how reads within a transaction go to the master

```ruby
Role.transaction do
  r = Role.where(:name => "manager").first
  r.description = 'Manager'
  r.save!
end
```

Log file output:

    03-13-12 06:02:09 pm,[2608],b[0],[0],  Role Load (2.0ms)  SELECT `roles`.* FROM `roles` WHERE `roles`.`name` = 'manager' LIMIT 1
    03-13-12 06:02:09 pm,[2608],b[0],[0],  AREL (2.0ms)  UPDATE `roles` SET `description` = 'Manager' WHERE `roles`.`id` = 4

### Forcing a read against the master

Sometimes it is necessary to read from the master:

```ruby
ActiveRecordSlave.read_from_master do
  r = Role.where(:name => "manager").first
end
```

## Usage Notes

### delete_all

Delete all executes against the master database since it is only a delete:

```
D, [2012-11-06T19:47:29.125932 #89772] DEBUG -- :   SQL (1.0ms)  DELETE FROM "users"
```

### destroy_all

First performs a read against the slave database and then deletes the corresponding
data from the master

```
D, [2012-11-06T19:43:26.890674 #89002] DEBUG -- :   Slave: User Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users"
D, [2012-11-06T19:43:26.890972 #89002] DEBUG -- :    (0.0ms)  begin transaction
D, [2012-11-06T19:43:26.891667 #89002] DEBUG -- :   SQL (0.4ms)  DELETE FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = ?  [["id", 3]]
D, [2012-11-06T19:43:26.892697 #89002] DEBUG -- :    (0.9ms)  commit transaction
```

## Transactions

By default ActiveRecordSlave detects when a call is inside a transaction and will
send all reads to the _master_ when a transaction is active.

With the latest Rails releases, Rails automatically wraps all Controller Action
calls with a transaction, effectively sending all reads to the master database.

It is now possible to send reads to database slaves and ignore whether currently
inside a transaction:

In file config/application.rb:

```ruby
# Read from slave even when in an active transaction
config.active_record_slave.ignore_transactions = true
```

It is important to identify any code in the application that depends on being
able to read any changes already part of the transaction, but not yet committed
and wrap those reads with `ActiveRecordSlave.read_from_master`

```ruby
# Create a new inquiry
Inquiry.create

# Then make sure that the new inquiry that is not yet committed is visible during
# the read below:
ActiveRecordSlave.read_from_master do
  count = Inquiry.count
end
```

## Dependencies

* Tested on Rails 3 and Rails 4

See [.travis.yml](https://github.com/reidmorrison/active_record_slave/.travis.yml) for the list of tested Ruby platforms

## Note

ActiveRecord::Base.execute is sometimes used to perform custom SQL calls against
the database to bypass ActiveRecord. It is necessary to replace these calls
with the standard ActiveRecord::Base.select call for them to be picked up by
active_record_slave and redirected to the slave.

This is because ActiveRecord::Base.execute can also be used for database updates
which we do not want redirected to the slave

## Install

  gem install active_record_slave

## Configuration

To enable slave reads for any environment just add a _slave:_ entry to database.yml
along with all the usual ActiveRecord database configuration options.

For Example:

```yaml
development:
  database: myapp_development
  username: root
  password:
  encoding: utf8
  adapter:  mysql
  host:     127.0.0.1
  pool:     20
  slave:
    database: myapp_development_replica
    username: root
    password:
    encoding: utf8
    adapter:  mysql
    host:     127.0.0.1
    pool:     20
```

Sometimes it is useful to turn on slave reads per host, for example to activate
slave reads only on the linux host 'batch':

```yaml
development:
  database: myapp_development
  username: root
  password:
  encoding: utf8
  adapter:  mysql
  host:     127.0.0.1
  pool:     20
<% if `hostname`.strip == 'batch' %>
  slave:
    database: myapp_development_replica
    username: root
    password:
    encoding: utf8
    adapter:  mysql
    host:     127.0.0.1
    pool:     20
<% end %>
```

## Possible Future Enhancements

* Support for multiple slaves (ask for it by submitting an issue)
